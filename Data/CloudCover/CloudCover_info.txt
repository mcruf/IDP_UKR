Cloud coverage relates to the percentage of cloud cover for the given Image tile.

Maxar provides cloud coverage only for the entire image that is downloaded.
However, we need the cloud coverage relative to the AOI, and more specifically,
For the image area covered of the AOI.

This was achieved by accessing the information from the API call, via the script
imagery_cloud_cover_loop.py

The script provided 2 output files:
- cloud_img_results.csv
- fail_data_log.csv

The first file provides the results for each individual image.
The second file provides information for the images for which cloud coverage could not be computed.

If the script returns any log files, please check more carefully the reason for why the computation failed.
