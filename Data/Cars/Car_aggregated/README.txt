# This folder stores the aggreagted car data version.
# I.e., we have the total no. of cars per image.

# The aggregation is conducted individually for each confidence threshold 
(0.15, 0.45), and considered car classes (18 or multiple car classes, as 
done in the past).

# Data generated by Ferda through the script:
obtain_metadata_ukraine3.py


# NOTE: The generated files were NOT cleaned. 
# There was no OSM nor Population threshold filtering approach.

# Thus, these data should only be used to retrieve images with zero car 
detections and image features. In the Data/Cars/Car_coords folder, images 
with zero car detections were not kept in the processing pipline. These 
has to be retrieved from the current folder.
